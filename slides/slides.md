# Labour of Grace
## Psalm 127

>>>
+ Today's passage challenges us to focus
  + not on what we've **earned**
  + but on God's **grace** toward us
+ instead of boasting in my **capability**:
  + what I can **accomplish**, skills, talents
+ boast in my **inability**:
  + complete **reliance** on God's power:

<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
## The most **valuable** <br/> things in life
## are not **earned** by hard work
## but given by God's **grace**

>>>
+ Ps127 is one of 15 psalms of **ascents**:
+ going up **Jerusalem** hill to worship
  + Levites up 15 steps to **temple**
+ train proper **attitude** as we worship God

Unless the Lord **builds** the house, <br/>

In vain you **rise early** <br/>

[Psalm 127:1a (NIV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ to "build" refers to **projects** / endeavours:
  + education, **career**
  + "house" often refers to **family**, legacy
+ "in vain" (*shav*): worthless, false, **deceptive**
  + has a moral **negative** connotation
+ contrast with *hebel* (Eccl): breath, fleeting
  + which only means **empty**, e.g., Abel
+ not a **prediction** of the outcome
  + i.e., "you could try, but you'll fail"
+ but a moral **judgment**:
  + "you build according to a **lie**"
  + your **value** system deceives you
  + **contrary** to God's truth
+ applies not just to "**worldly**" projects (money)
  + even projects done **for God**:
+ e.g., King **David**, when secure in reign
  + proposed a great **project** for God:

he said to Nathan the prophet,

“Here I am, living in a **house of cedar**, <br/>
while the **ark** of the covenant of the Lord <br/>
is under a **tent**.”

[1 Chronicles 17:1 (NIV) (p.1/3)](# "ref")

>>>
+ this is a big **investment**: labour, money
  + David figured he had **resources**

over My people Israel.

[1 Chronicles 17:4,7 (NIV) (p.2/3)](# "ref")

[Psalm 127:1b (NIV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "watches": **keep**, protect, hold fast
  + "stand watch": stay **awake**
+ this refers to our sense of **security**
  + i.e., what do we **fear**?
+ What is my **safety net**?  Money? Education?
  + US: guns
+ As I get old/ill: how will I **survive**?
  + worry about enough money in **retirement**
+ Jesus gives us **comfort** in famous
  + Sermon on the Mount:

---
<!-- .slide: <%= bg("unsplash-8CwoHpZe3qE-hands.jpg") %> -->
So **do not worry**, saying,

‘What shall we **eat**?’ <br/>
or ‘What shall we **drink**?’ <br/>
or ‘What shall we **wear**?’

For the **pagans** run after all these things, <br/>
and your **heavenly Father** <br/>
**knows** that you need them.

[Matthew 6:31-32 (NIV) (p.1/2)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "pagans": whole rest of the **world**
  + focus on **earning** living
  + **saving** up to provide safety net
+ not that it is **wrong** to save money!
+ the problem is **worry**:
  + (Ps37) do not **fret**: leads only to evil
+ worry takes our eyes off of
  + what should be our **priority**:

<!-- .slide: <%= bg("unsplash-8CwoHpZe3qE-hands.jpg") %> -->
But seek first **his kingdom** <br/>
and **his righteousness**,

and all these things <br/>
will be given to you as well.

[Matthew 6:33 (NIV) (p.2/2)](# "ref")

>>>
+ God's definition of **success**:

+ **Security** comes from:

all the days of your life.
