Children are a **heritage** from the Lord, <br/>
offspring a **reward** from him. <br/>
Like **arrows** in the hands of a **warrior** <br/>
are children born in one’s youth.

**Blessed** is the man <br/>
whose quiver is full of them. <br/>
They will not be put to **shame** <br/>
when they **contend** with their opponents in court.
